### Stage 1 Works

- Dice Rolling
- Score Calculation
- Banking the Scores

### Stage 2 Works

- Code an interactive cli-based game to deal with given interaction cases

### Stage 3 Works
- Implement Zilch feature in game.py
- Implement Cheat in game.py

### Stage 4 Works
**Adding an AI bot to play the game**

- Based on the outputs we got from running the bots program, some changes were done in the game.py file.
- Sonny Class has been added to the bots.py file which inherits from the BaseBot Class with two methods, the _roll_bank_or_quit and the _enter_dice which overrides the methods in the BaseBot Class.
- _roll_bank_or_quit and the _enter_dice methods are implemented in a way that Sonny beats Nervous Nellie
